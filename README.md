# Chrome-Extensions-
Google Chrome extensions are programs you can install in your Chrome browser to change its functionality.

These extensions can help you automate certain functions in your browser, modify existing behaviors, and improve your softwareâ€™s convenience. There are even Chrome extensions that can improve your SEO.

Chrome extensions are built with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS scripts and are essentially small websites uploaded to the Chrome store.

The only difference between a Chrome extension and a regular website is that extensions contain a manifest file, which gives them a specific function to execute.
